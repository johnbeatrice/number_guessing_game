# number guessing game


# When you run your script, you should prompt the user for a username with "Enter your username:", 
# and take a username as input. Your database should allow usernames that are 22 characters

# If that username has been used before, it should print 
# "Welcome back, <username>! You have played <games_played> games, and your best game took <best_game> guesses."
# , with <username> being a users name from the database, <games_played> being the total number of games that user has played, 
# and <best_game> being the fewest number of guesses it took that user to win the game

# If the username has not been used before, you should print "Welcome, <username>! It looks like this is your first time here."

# The next line printed should be "Guess the secret number between 1 and 1000:" and input from the user should be read

# Until they guess the secret number, it should print "It's lower than that, guess again:" 
# if the previous input was higher than the secret number, and "It's higher than that, guess again:" 
# if the previous input was lower than the secret number. Asking for input each time until they input the secret number.

# If anything other than an integer is input as a guess, it should print "That is not an integer, guess again:"

# When the secret number is guessed, your script should print 
# "You guessed it in <number_of_guesses> tries. The secret number was <secret_number>. Nice job!" and finish running
